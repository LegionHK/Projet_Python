# Projet_Python
This dataset summarizes an heterogeneous set of features about articles published by Mashable in a period of two years.
The goal is to predict the number of shares in social networks (popularity).

At the beginning the objective was to predict the number of shares but it appears that despite the number of data, the predictive 
variables defined do not allow us to solve the problem of regression.
So by defining the popularity of an article, we can redefine our problem to a classification problem that we can answer with our data.
